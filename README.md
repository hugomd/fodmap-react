This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This project was created to provide an easy way to search through ingredients to find out whether they are FODMAP-free.  

It uses data sets from [Melanie Huang](https://github.com/melaniehuang/fodmap-web) and [Tim Benniks](https://github.com/timbenniks/FODMAP).

The website is freely accessible from this URL: https://fodmap.now.sh

If you find any bugs or missing features, feel free to open a [new issue](https://github.com/hugomd/fodmap-react/issues/new) here on GitHub. If you would like to contribute, please fork the repo and make a pull request and I'll get to it when I have time!
